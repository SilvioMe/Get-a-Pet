# About the project

Link: https://lovedog-frontend.onrender.com/

Love Dog is a full stack web application that consists of a dog adoption website, where owners can register and display dogs without owners to find a new home through the DogLove platform. Users interested in adopting a dog can register on the website and request a visit to meet the pet, along with the owner. After the meeting, the current owner of the dog can confirm the adoption, finalizing the process and giving the dog a new family.
